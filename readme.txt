The TxtVox Plugin lets you mobilize your blog and provide 
readers with free SMS alerts when new posts are available, 
while generating revenue for you.

== Description ==

TxtVox connects mobile subscribers with blogs, newsletters, 
podcasts and other information sources through an innovative 
combination of advertising-supported text messaging and 
personalized mobile pages.

The TxtVox Plugin for WordPress lets you easily make mobile 
alerts available with a few simple steps. TxtVox is free 
to its publishing partners and subscribers and is accessible 
from more than 213 million cell phones nationwide. 

The TxtVox Plugin will instantly mobilize your content and 
deliver relevant text messaging alerts to interested readers. 
TxtVox delivers text messages when new content is available 
and allows subscribers to read it on the go through a 
personalized WAP or HTML page on their mobile device. Every 
time your reader interacts with one of our ads displayed 
alongside your content, we share the revenue with you.  
You will receive your revenue share payment at the beginning 
of each month.

When the TxtVox system sends an alert to your readers, it 
presents your content in the best possible format through a 
combination of SMS messages and mobile Web pages displaying 
the mobile version of your WordPress posts. We take care of 
all technical details, including carrier connectivity (we 
work with all of the major carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, 
Sprint/Nextel, T-Mobile, Alltel, Virgin, etc.), format 
conversion, tracking and reporting.
